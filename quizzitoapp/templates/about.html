                Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Emmanuel Eddie Joshua Kweh 
                (Demiz) and I am a 20-year-old web developer from Ghana. I have been programming 
                for two years and I love creating websites that are user-friendly, 
                responsive and dynamic. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Python, Django, 
                JavaScript and SQL, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and 
                improve my skills. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and create web 
                applications that can solve real-world problems and make a positive impact. 
                I hope you enjoy browsing this quiz website and feel free to contact me if 
                you have any questions or feedback. Thank you for visiting!
            </p>
